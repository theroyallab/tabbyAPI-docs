# Usage
TabbyAPI's main use-case is to be an API server for running ExllamaV2 models.

### API Server
Currently TabbyAPI supports clients that use the [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) standard and [KoboldAI](https://lite.koboldai.net/koboldcpp_api)'s API.

In addition, there are expanded parameters to generation endpoints along with administrative endpoints for loading, unloading, loras, sampling overrides, etc.

!!! note
    If you are a developer and want to add full TabbyAPI support to your app, it's recommended to use the [autogenerated documentation](https://theroyallab.github.io/tabbyAPI).

Below is an example CURL request using the OpenAI completions endpoint:
```
curl http://localhost:5000/v1/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B",
  "prompt": "Once upon a time,",
  "max_tokens": 400,
  "stream": false,
  "min_p": 0.05,
  "repetition_penalty": 1.05
}'
```

### Authentication
Every call to a TabbyAPI endpoint requires some form of authentication. Keys have two types of permissions:
- API: Accesses non-invasive endpoints (ex. generation, model list fetching)
- Admin: Allowed to access protected endpoints that deal with resources (ex. loading, unloading)

In addition, when calling list endpoints, API keys will only fetch the currently loaded object while admin keys will list the entire directory. For example, calling `/v1/models` will return a list of the user-configured models directory only if an admin key is passed.

Therefore, it's recommended to keep the admin key for yourself and only share the api key with users.

If these keys get compromised, shut down your server, delete the `api_tokens.yml` file, and restart. This will generate new keys which you can share with users.

To bypass authentication checks, set `disable_auth` to `True` in config.yml. However, turning off authentication without a third-party solution will make your instance open to the world.

### Difficult to get started?
Is the API difficult? Don't want to load models with `config.yml`? That's okay! Not everyone is a master user of AI products when starting out. 

For newer users, it's recommended to use a UI that allows for managing TabbyAPI via API endpoints.

To find UI projects, take a look at [Community Projects](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI/wiki/09.-Community-Projects) for more information.

The [Discord](https://discord.gg/sYQxnuD7Fj) is also a great place to ask for help. Please be nice when asking questions as all the developers are volunteers who have lives outside of TabbyAPI.
